# ApplicationBots

Welcome to ApplicationBots!

This repository is meant for some of my personal side-projects, which I mainly pursue as a hobby during my own free time. For my ongoing, as well as my past school projects, please visit **DimitrisMantas**/iCollect, /Nu.mTools and /TriMeshTools.

ApplicationBots contains bots for some of the most well-known desktop and mobile applications and games.

## Disclaimer

1. All programs have been verified to be in decent working condition, but they have not been debugged using test cases.

2. The runtime of said programs is sufficient, but it is obvious that there are both more efficient and prettier ways to achieve the same results.

3. All programs are meant for educational and entertainment purposes only. I am not to be held responsible in case one or more of my programs are used maliciously by a third-party.
