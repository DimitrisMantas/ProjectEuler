# ProjectEuler

Welcome to ProjectEuler!

This repository is meant for some of my personal side-projects, which I mainly pursue as a hobby during my own free time. For my ongoing, as well as my past school projects, please visit **DimitrisMantas**/iCollect, /Nu.mTools and /TriMeshTools.

ProjectEuler contains solutions to some of the most well-known computational problems, which are featured on the popular [website](https://projecteuler.net/) of the same name.

## Disclaimer

1. All programs have been manually verified by myself to be in sufficient working order. This means that each one exhibits normal behavior and produces the correct answer to its respective problem, but it has neither been debugged nor profiled using standaridised test cases whatsoever.

2. The runtime of each program also sufficient and the lies within the order of seconds, but it is obvious that there are both more efficient and prettier ways to write them. To someone, who is willing to do all that, your contribution is an invaluable learning tool to me and you are more than welcome to do so.

3. All programs are meant for educational and entertainment purposes only. I am not and will not be held responsible in any way for any kind of damage, which might be caused by one or more of my programs being used maliciously and/or illegaly by a third-party.
